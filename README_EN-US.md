# Hangman Project

[PT-BR](https://github.com/Luizfelz/forca-desafio-santander-coders)

The 'Hangman Projetc' is a challenge proposed by the professor of the first module of the Santander Coders program, in partnership with Ada, whose objective is to develop a code for the [Hangman Game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>).

The purpose of the challege was to make the students test their skills with the contents taught in the classroom, which included functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc., in addition to enabling the evaluation of criteria such as code reprodutibility and clarity.

The file 'enunciado.txt' contains the statement of the challege proposed by the professor (in Portuguese-Brazil), with details and necessary informations for its realization.

## Program execution...

### ...by terminal

To run the Hangman Game throught the terminal, download the files:

- app.py
- \_\_init\_\_.py
- funcoes.py
- frutas.txt

and save them all in the same folder.

Then, open the terminal in this folder and run the command:

```
python app.py
```

The program will run and the game will start.

### ... by Colab or Jupyter notebook

To run the Hangman Game throught Colab or Jupyter notebook, download the files:

- game.ipynb
- frutas.txt

and put them in the same folder in the environment of the [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/retro/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb). Then, open the 'game.ipynb' file.

Or, if you prefer, click here: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Luizfelz/forca-desafio-santander-coders/blob/main/game.ipynb)

Remember: the 'frutas.txt' file must be placed in the same folder as the 'game.ipynb' file so that Colab or Jupyter notebook can run the program correctly.
