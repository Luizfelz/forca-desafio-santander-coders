# Hangman Project

[PT-BR](https://github.com/Luizfelz/forca-desafio-santander-coders)

The 'Hangman Projetc' is a challenge proposed by the professor of the first module of the Santander Coders program, in partnership with Ada, whose objective is to develop a code for the [Hangman Game](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)>).

The purpose of the challege was to make the students test their skills with the contents taught in the classroom, which included functions, lists, tuples, dictionaries, etc., in addition to enabling the evaluation of criteria such as code reprodutibility and clarity.

The file 'enunciado.txt' contains the statement of the challege proposed by the professor (in Portuguese-Brazil), with details and necessary informations for its realization.

## Program execution...

### ...by terminal

To run the Hangman Game throught the terminal, clone this repository. Then, open the terminal in this folder and enter the command:

```
python app.py
```

The program will run and the game will start.

### ... by Colab or Jupyter notebook

To run the Hangman Game throught Colab or Jupyter notebook, clone this repository in a local folder. Then, open the 'game.ipynb' file using [Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/?utm_source=scs-index) or [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/try-jupyter/retro/notebooks/?path=notebooks/Intro.ipynb). **Make sure that Colab and Jupyter can read all the files from the same folder when opening 'game.ipynb' with them.**

Or, if you prefer, click here to open it directly in Colab: [![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Luizfelz/forca-desafio-santander-coders/blob/main/game.ipynb)
